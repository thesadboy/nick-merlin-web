The Network Services filter blocks the LAN to WAN packet exchanges and restricts devices from using specific network services.<p>For example, if you do not want the device to use the Internet service, key in 80 in the destination port. The traffic that uses port 80 will be blocked.<p>Leave the source IP field blank to apply this rule to all LAN devices.
Enable the firewall to protect your local area network against attacks from hackers. The firewall filters the incoming and outgoing packets based on the filter rules.
<b>Black List Duration :</b> During the scheduled duration, clients in the Black List cannot use the specified network services. After the specified duration, all the clients in LAN can access the specified network services.<br><b>White List Duration :</b> During the scheduled duration, clients in the White List can ONLY use the specified network services. After the specified duration, clients in the White List and other network clients will not be able to access the Internet or any Internet service.
<b>NOTE :</b> If you set the subnet for the White List, IP addresses outside the subnet will not be able to access the Internet or any Internet service.
MAC filter allows you to accept or deny network access for devices with specific MAC addresses.<p>You can set the MAC filter to the Accept or Reject mode.<p>In the Reject mode, devices in the list are denied access to the network.<p>In the Accept mode, only the devices that are in the list can access the network. The devices that are not in the list are denied access to the network.
A \"denial-of-service\" attack is an explicit attempt to deny legitimate users from using a service or computer resource.<p>Enabling this feature can protect the router from DoS attack but it would increase the router's workload.

NAT (Network Address Translation) is a process used in routers to replace the address information of network packet with new address information. Typical applications for NAT is router which connect to LAN with the WAN. In LAN every network devices had a private IP(LAN IP) but there is only one public IP(WAN IP). To grant the network devices access to the Internet, the router replaces the private IP address of the sender with its own public IP address in all outgoing data packets. The router saves all necessary information in a table(NAT table) so that incoming data packets can then be assigned on the correct network device.

Port range accepts various formats such as Port Range (300:350), individual ports (566,789) or Mix (1015:1024,3021)
Port Trigger allows you to temporarily open data ports when LAN devices require unrestricted access to the Internet. There are two methods for opening incoming data ports: port forwarding and port trigger. Port forwarding opens the specified data ports all the time and devices must use static IP addresses. Port trigger only opens the incoming port when a LAN device requests access to the trigger port. Unlike port forwarding, port trigger does not require static IP addresses for LAN devices. Port forwarding allows multiple devices to share a single open port and port trigger only allows one client at a time to access the open port.

Well-Known Applications
UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) allows several devices (routers, televisions, stereo systems, game consoles, cellular phone) to be controlled via an IP-based network with or without a central control through a gateway.
Enable Port Forwarding
Virtual Server / Port forwarding allows remote computers to connect to a specific computer or service within a private local area network (LAN). For a faster connection, some P2P applications (such as BitTorrent), may also require that you set the port forwarding setting. Please refer to the P2P application's user manual for details. You can open the multiple port or a range of ports in router and redirect data through those ports to a single client on your network. <p>If you want to specify a Port Range for clients on the same network, enter the Service Name, the Port Range (e.g. 10200:10300), the LAN IP address, and leave the Local Port empty.

From the User-defined QoS rules dropdown list, you can prioritize the network applications or devices into five levels. Based on priority level, QoS uses the following methods in sending data packets:<ul><li>Change the order of upstream network packets, which refer to the order in which packets are sent to the Internet.</li><li>Low-priority packets are disregarded to ensure the transmission of high-priority packets. The higher priority upstream packet will cause the higher priority downstream packet.</li><li>If there are no packets being sent from high-priority applications, the full transmission rate of the Internet connection is available for low-priority packets.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Enable QoS then set up the upload and download rate limits.</li></ul>
Transferred
In the 'Transferred column', set the network traffic limit (in KB) for a specific service to generate specific priorities for the service assigned to a specific port. For example, if two network clients, PC 1 and PC 2, are both accessing the Internet (set at port 80), but PC 1 exceeded the network traffic limit due to some downloading tasks, PC 1 will be given a lower priority. The Transferred column refers to the upstream and downstream traffic (outgoing and incoming network traffic) for one session. If you do not want to set the traffic limit, you can leave it blank.
Enable QoS then set up the user-defined rules.
By default, the priority for upload and download bandwidth is "low". If there is no bandwidth priority rule, the priority for both upload and download bandwidth is "low".

Enable efficient multicast forwarding (IGMP Snooping)
When this option is enabled, router performance will improve in an environment where there is high interference, but it might reduce connection stability under some circumstances.
Enhanced interference management
Explicit beamforming
The client's WLAN adapter and router both support beamforming technology. This technology allows these devices to communicate channel estimation and steering direction to each other to improve download and uplink speed.
Fragmentation Threshold sets the frame size of incoming messages (ranging from 256 to 2346 bytes) used as fragmentation boundary. If the frame size is too big, the heavy interference affects transmission reliability. If the frame size is too small, it decreases transmission efficiency.

Reducing USB 3.0 interference
Enabling this feature ensures the best wireless performance on the 2.4 GHz band. Disabling this feature increases USB 3.0 port\'s transmission speed and may affect the 2.4 GHz wireless range.
Region
This field specifies the interval (in seconds) after which a WPA group key is changed . Enter [0] (zero) to indicate that a periodic key-change is not required.
Group Key Rotation Interval
In network configurations that involve multiple Access Points or wireless repeaters, wireless clients sometimes cannot connect automatically to the best available AP because they are still connected to the main wireless router. Enable this setting so that the client will disconnect from the main wireless router if the signal strength is under a specific threshold and connect to a stronger signal.
Lower the signal RTS (Request To Send) to promote the transmission efficiency in condition of noisy environment or too many clients.
RTS Threshold
Allows administrators to specify when the wireless network will power off to conserve energy and maintain network security.

The Preamble type defines the length of the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) block, which is a technique for detecting data transmission errors among wireless devices. We recommend that you configure all wireless devices to the same preamble type. Use short preamble for wireless devices in high network traffic areas. Use long preamble for older wireless devices.

WPA-PSK key
You can easily connect a WPS client to the network in either of these two ways:<ul><li>Method1: Click the WPS button on this interface (or press the physical WPS button on the router), then press the WPS button on the client's WLAN adapter and wait for about three minutes to make the connection.</li><li>Method2: Start the client WPS process and get the client PIN code. Enter the client's PIN code on the Client PIN code field and click Start. Please check the user manual of your wireless client to see if it supports the WPS function. If your wireless client does not support the WPS function, you have to configure the wireless client manually and set the same network Name (SSID), and security settings as this router.</li></ul>
