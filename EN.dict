NAT (Network Address Translation) is a process used in routers to replace the address information of network packet with new address information. Typical applications for NAT is router which connect to LAN with the WAN. In LAN every network devices had a private IP(LAN IP) but there is only one public IP(WAN IP). To grant the network devices access to the Internet, the router replaces the private IP address of the sender with its own public IP address in all outgoing data packets. The router saves all necessary information in a table(NAT table) so that incoming data packets can then be assigned on the correct network device.

For source or destination IP address, you can : (a) enter a specific IP address, such as \"192.168.122.1\"; (b) enter IP addresses within one subnet or within the same IP pool, such as \"192.168.123.*\", or \"192.168.*.*\"; or (c) enter all IP addresses as \"*.*.*.*\".
IP Sharing
IP Sharing: Most ISPs commonly use this mode. In IP sharing mode, the Wireless ADSL Modem Router connects to the Internet and LAN clients share one public IP address.

Special Applications
IP Address of Exposed Station
Virtual DMZ allows you to expose one computer to the Internet, so that all the inbounds packets will be redirected to the computer you set. It is useful while you run some applications that use uncertained incoming ports. Please use it carefully.
WAN IP Setting
Key in the LAN client's IP address.
Leave this field blank if you want the incoming packets to be redirected to this port.
Port range accepts various formats such as Port Range (300:350), individual ports (566,789) or Mix (1015:1024,3021)
Port Trigger allows you to temporarily open data ports when LAN devices require unrestricted access to the Internet. There are two methods for opening incoming data ports: port forwarding and port trigger. Port forwarding opens the specified data ports all the time and devices must use static IP addresses. Port trigger only opens the incoming port when a LAN device requests access to the trigger port. Unlike port forwarding, port trigger does not require static IP addresses for LAN devices. Port forwarding allows multiple devices to share a single open port and port trigger only allows one client at a time to access the open port.

Well-Known Applications
UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) allows several devices (routers, televisions, stereo systems, game consoles, cellular phone) to be controlled via an IP-based network with or without a central control through a gateway.
Enable Port Forwarding
Virtual Server / Port forwarding allows remote computers to connect to a specific computer or service within a private local area network (LAN). For a faster connection, some P2P applications (such as BitTorrent), may also require that you set the port forwarding setting. Please refer to the P2P application's user manual for details. You can open the multiple port or a range of ports in router and redirect data through those ports to a single client on your network. <p>If you want to specify a Port Range for clients on the same network, enter the Service Name, the Port Range (e.g. 10200:10300), the LAN IP address, and leave the Local Port empty.

From the User-defined QoS rules dropdown list, you can prioritize the network applications or devices into five levels. Based on priority level, QoS uses the following methods in sending data packets:<ul><li>Change the order of upstream network packets, which refer to the order in which packets are sent to the Internet.</li><li>Low-priority packets are disregarded to ensure the transmission of high-priority packets. The higher priority upstream packet will cause the higher priority downstream packet.</li><li>If there are no packets being sent from high-priority applications, the full transmission rate of the Internet connection is available for low-priority packets.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Enable QoS then set up the upload and download rate limits.</li></ul>
Transferred
In the 'Transferred column', set the network traffic limit (in KB) for a specific service to generate specific priorities for the service assigned to a specific port. For example, if two network clients, PC 1 and PC 2, are both accessing the Internet (set at port 80), but PC 1 exceeded the network traffic limit due to some downloading tasks, PC 1 will be given a lower priority. The Transferred column refers to the upstream and downstream traffic (outgoing and incoming network traffic) for one session. If you do not want to set the traffic limit, you can leave it blank.
Enable QoS then set up the user-defined rules.
By default, the priority for upload and download bandwidth is "low". If there is no bandwidth priority rule, the priority for both upload and download bandwidth is "low".

The Preamble type defines the length of the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) block, which is a technique for detecting data transmission errors among wireless devices. We recommend that you configure all wireless devices to the same preamble type. Use short preamble for wireless devices in high network traffic areas. Use long preamble for older wireless devices.
Preamble Type

You can easily connect a WPS client to the network in either of these two ways:<ul><li>Method1: Click the WPS button on this interface (or press the physical WPS button on the router), then press the WPS button on the client's WLAN adapter and wait for about three minutes to make the connection.</li><li>Method2: Start the client WPS process and get the client PIN code. Enter the client's PIN code on the Client PIN code field and click Start. Please check the user manual of your wireless client to see if it supports the WPS function. If your wireless client does not support the WPS function, you have to configure the wireless client manually and set the same network Name (SSID), and security settings as this router.</li></ul>
